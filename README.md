# GatesOfLogic
User/Data-driven customizable logic gates

## What does that mean?
When this project is complete, you will be able to declare Logic Gates in JSON files (or whatever medium I decide to use) and put inputs through them to get outputs.

This means you should be able to set up a complete Binary Adder. This could be done by either using the base gates, but as I designed this software to be able to use 
previously declared nodes you should be able to make one with multiple custom Nodes aswell.

## Is it ready?
No. I haven't even tested if it works yet
